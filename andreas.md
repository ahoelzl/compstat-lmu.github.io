About

I am an external PhD student at the department of statistics at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich in the working group 
computational statistics. I did my bachelor in statistics with a minor in computer science and continued with a 
master's degree in statistics here at the LMU. I work on my industrial PhD at Siemens about 
the "Alignment of semantic and Big Data Technologies".
