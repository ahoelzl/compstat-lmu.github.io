This is the webpage of the working group computational statistics at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich. Since summer 2015 [Prof. Dr. Bernd Bischl](/people/bischl/) is head of the working group.

The research focus of the group is statistical computing, statistical learning,
model- and variable selection, biostatistics, classification, survival analysis, and predictive modelling.

The group also organizes the [Münchner R Kurse](http://www.statistik.lmu.de/R/), which are training courses in the statistical programming language [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
