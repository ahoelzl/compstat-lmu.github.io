## Software

I am the author or a major contributor to quite a large number of R packages.
Nearly all of them are listed and hosted under either my personal github page.
They mainly deal with machine learning, optimization and parallelization.

Major projects:
 
- [mlr](http://www.github.com/mlr-org/mlr) - A large ML toolbox for R. 
- [mlrMBO](http://www.github.com/berndbischl/mlrMBO) - Model-Based Optimization toolbox. 
- [OpenML R Package](http://www.github.com/OpenML/r) - OpenML connector in R. 
- [BatchJobs](http://www.github.com/tudo-r/BatchJobs) - Run R jobs on HPC clusters. 
- [BatchExperiments](http://www.github.com/tudo-r/BatchExperiments) - Structure your experiments
  nicely, then run them with BatchJobs.
- [parallelMap](http://www.github.com/berndbischl/parallelMap) - The names says it. Works also with
  BatchJobs.
- [aslib](http://www.aslib.net) - Algorithm selection repo.
- [aslib-r](http://www.github.com/coseal/aslib-r) - aslib connector for R.

## Awards

- Best dissertation award 2013 from Department of Statistics, TU Dortmund.
- I have regularly taught and lead a student team for the German Data Mining Cup competition. We scored 1st place in 2013 and 2011, and 2nd place in 2010 and 2013.
- Julia Schiffner, Claus Weihs and I won the best paper "Method Award" of the GfKl 2010 conference for our contribution "Bias-Variance Analysis of Local Classification Methods".
- Hong Qinyuan won the Industrial Challenge of the GECCO 2011 conference for his
"Dynamic Linear Trading System". He submitted his solution as a student under my supervision.
- Best intermediate diploma award in computer science from University of Hamburg.
